## Overview

The Sleep Analysis Project is a Python-based tool that helps you track and analyze your sleep patterns. The core of the analysis involves:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming raw sleep data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating relevant features for analysis and predictions.
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifying sleep trends and offering insights based on historical data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Using models like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to predict future sleep patterns and recommend health improvements.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

To install the necessary libraries, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt



1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/rajeshrj-git/sleep-analysis-project.git
cd sleep-analysis-project


2. Install Dependencies

    pip install -r requirements.txt


3.Running the Project:

   python run_analysis.py


4.Expected Output:

    Average Sleep Duration (Last 7 Days): 7.00 hours
    General Recommendation: Your average sleep duration is within a healthy range. Maintain consistency for optimal health.

    Sleep Trend Analysis: Your sleep hours are improving over time. Keep up the good work!

    If you maintain this sleep, your health will improve by 18.17% over the next 3 months.
